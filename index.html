        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web. </p>
        <p> In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.   </p>
        <h2>What is HTML? </h2>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.       </p>
        <p><strong>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: </strong>

            <ol>
                <li>The closing tag</li>
                <li>The actual element</li>
                <li>You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

        <p>
            There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:

            To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
            To build web applications
            To impress friends
            To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
    
            Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
